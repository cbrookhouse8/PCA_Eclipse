### PCA in Eclipse

It seems about time to turn this into an Eclipse project, probably about two years after making the [first working version](https://github.com/cbrookhouse8/3D_PCA) in the Processing IDE.

I wrote this PCA demo before I really understood the relationship between Processing and Java and probably suffered a lot for not having all the utilities of a modern Java IDE to help me with such a mass of spaghetti code.

I hope to tidy up the code a little and maybe swap out my own wireframe graphics for a fully featured 3D rederer and API.
